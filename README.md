This repository contains a basic Selenium automation script written in **JavaScript** to test core user functionalities of the **Trello** platform. It is part of the submission for **Round 1: Technical Test** of the Deepchain Labs QA Internship.

## ✅ What the Test Does, How to Install & Run It

The script automates the following steps:

1. Opens the Trello login page.
2. Logs in using hardcoded credentials (inside `test.js`).
3. Creates a new board titled `Automated Board <timestamp>`.
4. Adds a list titled **"To Do"**.
5. Adds a card titled **"Write Blog Post"** to that list.
6. Leaves the browser open for manual verification (you can close it with `Ctrl + C`).
